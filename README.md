K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
This project demonstrates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification on the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The workflow starts with loading and normalizing the feature set, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets. A KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn is used to train the model, and different values of K are tested to observe their effect on accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Additionally, decision boundaries are visualized for a two-feature subset to illustrate how KNN separates classes in feature space.
